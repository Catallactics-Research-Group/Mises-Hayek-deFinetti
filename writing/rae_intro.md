# Epigraph 

> *"Some 15 billion years ago, as best we can tell, we were a dense mass of exploding gasses. Today we are as we find ourselves, evolved into our present state of partially-informed being and knowing, but uncertain precisely about all we have been, and uncertain about what we will become. One thing we can be sure of is that there has been no repeatability of stable conditions that provides a real base for 'the primitive notion of probability' as something outside of ourselves. Probability is nothing other than the logic of our uncertain judgements about the world."* -- Frank Lad 


# Introduction 

In Zen legend there is a story about a sword blade so sharp that it cuts together and not apart. The mind of Bruno de Finetti is like unto that blade: so sharp that it cuts together rather than apart as we will demonstrate. Our claim is is at once simple and profound....

Austrian economics, properly understood, has unique probability foundations. These foundations are fully implied by Austrian price theory. Austrian economists have yet to fully comprehend and to subsequently embrace this unique view of probability. This probability theory is radically subjective and fully operational -- both philosophically and computationally. It is the operational subjective theory of Bruno de Finetti! We claim that de Finetti is the *Forgotten Austrian economist* and should be fully embraced as such. 

Our proposal is straightforward. It takes the form of a basic Dutch book argument. Austrians cannot reject de Finetti's subjective-economic derivation of probability without rejecting their own subjective price-theoretic foundations. At its core de Finetti's theory is a ***catallactic theory*** that assumes the institutions and market processes emphasized in Austrian foundations. Furthermore, de Finetti's theory is rationally required by catallactics. To reject de Finetti is entirely self-defeating for Austrians. It is to reject the very foundations upon which their entire edifice is built.
