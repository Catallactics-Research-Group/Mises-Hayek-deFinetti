# Contributing

This repository supports an interdisciplinary research project (literature synthesis + writing).
It contains exploratory notes, section drafts, and curated project artifacts.

## Where to put things

- 00_project_meta/
  Project-level artifacts: scope, research questions, proposal materials, decisions.

- 01_sources/
  Bibliography and source notes (summaries, quotes with citations, reading notes).

- 02_working_notes/
  Low-stakes exploratory work: brainstorms, rough notes, outlines, fragments.
  Personal author folders are welcome.

- 03_section_drafts/
  Draft text intended to become part of the paper (by section).
  Multiple competing drafts are OK.

- 04_integrated_draft/
  Curated integrated manuscript (only when we begin merging sections).

- 05_appendices/
  Material that is rigorous/useful but too detailed for the main narrative
  (formal derivations, extended examples, background).

- 06_archive/
  Old/unused drafts kept for reference. Nothing gets deleted, just retired.

## Editing norms (lightweight)

- Safe to edit freely:
  - 02_working_notes/
  - 01_sources/source_notes/
  - 03_section_drafts/

- Please use a pull request for:
  - 00_project_meta/ (project commitments affect everyone)
  - 04_integrated_draft/ (when populated)

## Style notes

- Rough prose is fine in working notes.
- When quoting sources, include page numbers when possible.
- If unsure where something belongs, default to 02_working_notes/.
