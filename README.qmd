This repository supports an interdisciplinary research project. The goal is literature synthesis and collaborative writing.

## Repository organization

The repository is organized to support exploratory work, draft writing, and eventual
integration into a single manuscript.

- `00_project_meta/`  
  Project-level artifacts (scope, proposals, shared decisions).

- `01_sources/`  
  Bibliography and source notes.

- `02_working_notes/`  
  Exploratory notes, brainstorms, outlines, and fragments.

- `03_section_drafts/`  
  Draft text intended to become part of the paper (organized by section).

- `04_integrated_draft/`  
  Reserved for the curated integrated manuscript (once sections are merged).

- `05_appendices/`  
  Technical details, extended examples, and background material.

- `06_archive/`  
  Archived or legacy material kept for reference.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidance on where to place new work and editing norms.

## Legacy structure

Folders related to earlier project templates (e.g. code, data, figures, writing scaffolds)
have been moved to:

`06_archive/legacy_structure/`

These are retained for reference but are not part of the active workflow.
