## Catallactics

Catallactics is an alternative take on economics, one that uses a process view of markets to answer questions about the coordinating role of institutions in the context of individual decision-making under uncertainty. Rather than viewing the market at one equilbirium point in time and using calculus to exposite tautological relationships between supply, demand, quantity and price, catallactics looks at the exchange-driven evolution of institutions and their role in coordinating human action. 

Contextual to this are Hayek's knowledge problems as presented in Hayek 1937, and the Mengerian as opposed to Walrasian approach to economic analysis (think process oriented focus on institutions as opposed to static equilibrium analysis). 

We want to provide mathematical foundations for catallactic models based on Bruno de Finetti's subjective probability theory.
