# Economics as Human Action 

> *"Economics has two tasks. The first is to make the world around us intelligible in terms of human action and the pursuit of plans. The second is to trace the unintended consequences of such action."* -- Ludwig Lachmann 


> *"Economists 'should' concentrate their attention on a particular form of human activity, and upon the various institutional arrangements that arise as a result of this form of activity. Man's behavior in the market relationship, reflecting the propensity to truck and to barter, and the manifold variations in structure that this relationship can take; these are the proper subjects for the economist's study."* -- James M. Buchanan 

Elsewhere Buchanan restates this as the following: 


> **"Economics is about arbitrage.** *The behavioral paradigm central to economics is that of the trader whose Smithean propensity to truck and barter locates and creates opportunities for mutual gains. This paradigm is contrasted with that of the maximizing engineer who allocates scarce resources among alternatives. As several of the essays in this volume have suggested, the maximization paradigm is the fatal methodological flaw in modern economics."*
