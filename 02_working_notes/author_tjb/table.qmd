| **Core Framework** | Focuses on static equilibrium models and simultaneous equations. Treats non-simultaneous magnitudes as if they exist at the same time. | Focuses on a dynamic "genetic-causal" process of learning and discovery. Rejects equilibrium as a description of reality.|
| **Nature of Prices** | Prices are "parametric" (given inputs) to the decision-making process. They are treated as independent variables or "given data".| Prices are "endogenous" outcomes emerging from subjective human choices. They are the phenomena to be explained, not just inputs.|
| **Knowledge Assumptions** | Assumes actors have perfect relevant knowledge or that prices contain all necessary information ("sufficient statistics"). Knowledge is objective and "out there".| Knowledge is fragmentary, subjective, and prone to error. Actors face "sheer ignorance". Knowledge is created and discovered during the market process.|
| **Function of Prices** | Functions primarily in an *ex ante* role as inputs for utility and profit maximization. Prices are sources for inferring information.| Functions in three distinct roles: *ex ante* calculation, *ex post* feedback (profit/loss signals), and *discovery* (spurring entrepreneurial alertness). Prices are "knowledge surrogates".|
| **Disequilibrium** | Disequilibrium prices are often viewed as inefficient because they contain faulty information.| Disequilibrium prices are essential to the process; they provide the information and incentives necessary for entrepreneurs to correct errors and discover profit opportunities.|
| **Role of Time** | Synchronizes a state of affairs ("static" approach).| Emphasizes time and error, recognizing that production takes place over time and involves "becoming".|
