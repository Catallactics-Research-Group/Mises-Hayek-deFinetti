(transcribed from 1/16/26 meeting)

1. Introduction

    - intellectual arbitrage
    - define arbitrage, using the definition of Mises (or from previous Tyler paper where he defines it?)

2. Arbitrage Triangle

    - Arbitrage foundations of catallactic 
        - knowledge problem
        - Hayek
        - Harper (maybe?)

    - Arbitrage foundations of BdF 
        - dutch book -> define a probability by “the dutch book” the correct probability is the no-arbitrage value
        - At the end of the day, each person acts rationally according to their own internal “subjective probability”
        - Each person is acting, rationally, according to their own probability function and they adhere to the three axioms
        - We show our values through our interactions with price and money systems

        **Notes:**

        Exchangability? What role does it play?
    - Arbitrage foundations of finance
        - No-arbitrage in a perfect market system (equilibrium state) and this is how we pick our “rational prices” 
        - Convergence to equilibrium (convergence to no-arbitrage setting) very quickly, and so most of the papers are about the no-arbitrage condition
        - How does this happen through the pricing mechanism (make this formal using probability)

3. deFinetti as a catallactic: 

    **Goal:** prove that there is an Austrian interpretation of BdF that is powerful
    - You can assign probabilities to things that can’t be repeated infinitely often via a bet, so it is personal and complicated
    - deFinetti defines probability in exactly the same ways as the Austrians want to understand the economy. He defines probability using social interaction, and therefore the fact that the economy is a social system is inherently built in
    - deFinetti uses probability, price, and prevision interchangeably
    - Also, will want to rely Bernardo and Smith here, with countable additivity; they cite Lad but don't require commitment to finite addivitity perspective.
    - There's going to possibly be some connection to proper scoring functions, but it requires some thinking. 

4. BdF to finance: 

    - Mengerian view of price?
    - How does price result in coordination? What is actually the mechanism?
    - Distribution of market, transformation of measure to “risk-neutral” setting through radon-nikodym derivative? Question: why do we assume it absolutely continuous? Is there some justification for this? 
    - Fundamental theorem of provision = fundamental theorem of asset pricing
    - Can rebuild the foundation of finance using these ideas? 

5. Real Option

6. Computational statistical catallactics

    **OR:** how the evaluation game follows from these ideas

    - Agent-based computational economics 

    **Notes:**
    - This is where the hydrodynamic limit start to come into play
    - Agent for the marketplace (subjective probability distribution)

7. Conclusion
