# Introduction: Triangular Arbitrage

> ***Economics is about arbitrage.*** *The behavioral paradigm central to economics is that of the trader whose Smithean propensity to truck and barter locates and creates opportunities for mutual gains. This paradigm is contrasted with that of the maximizing engineer who allocates scarce resources among alternatives.... the maximizing paradigm is the fatal methodological flaw in modern economics.* -- James M. Buchanan

This paper is scientific triangular arbitrage. It is also fundamentally about arbitrage. We agree with Buchanan that arbitrage has not become central to economics as it should be. 


# Arbitrage Trinitarianism

## Arbitrage Foundations of Catallactics 

> ***Economics involves actors.*** *Without actors, there is no play. This truism has been overlooked by modern economists whose universe is peopled with passive responders to stimuli. If all are price-takers, who sets price? If all behavior is rationally responsive, how can change occur? How can entrepreneurship be modeled? Increasingly, I have come to the view that the role of entrepreneurship has been the most neglected area of economic inquiry, with significant normative implications for the general understanding of how the whole economy works.* -- James M. Buchanan

## Arbitrage Foundations of de Finetti's Operational Subjective Probability Theory

> *Some 15 billion years ago,as best we can tell, we were a dense mass of exploding gases. Today we are as we find ourselves, evolved into our present state of partially-informed being and knowing, but uncertain precisely about all we have been, and uncertain about what we will become. One thing we can be sure of is that there has been no repeatability of stable conditions that provides a real base for "the primitive notion of probability" as something outside of ourselves.* ***Probability is nothing other than the logic of our uncertain judgements about the world.*** -- Frank Lad

    - This is needed for the market-maker



## Arbitrage Foundations of Modern Finance 

> *[W]hen judged by its ability to explain the empirical data, option pricing theory is the most successful theory not only in finance, but in all of economics. It is now widely employed by the financial industry and its impact on economics has been far-ranging. At a theoretical level, we now understand that option pricing theory is a manifestation of the force of arbitrage and that this is the same force that underlies much of neoclassical finance.* -- Stephen A. Ross

# Bruno de Finetti: The Forgotten Austrian Catallactist

> *It was economic calculation that assigned to measurement, number, and reckoning the role they play in our quantitative and computing civilization.* -- Ludwig von Mises

- The fundamental claim of this section is that Bruno de Finetti's operational subjective derivation of probability is a ***catallactic theory***.
    - He relies upon money prices to elicit subjective probabilities. 
    - He agrees wholeheartedly with Mises about prices as "an aid to the mind"
    - Compare and contrast the Walrasian vs. the Mengerian view of price. See @Horwitz2000 Chapter 1.
    - Though he studies under Vilfredo Pareto, it is abundantly clear that his view of price is the subjective Mengerian one!

- @HarperJIE2010 establishes the "social ontology" of numerical toolkits for Misesian economic calculation.
    - Numbers are economic capital / economic institutions.
    - "Even institutional, evolutionary, and Austrian economists tend to take numbers for granted. They do not examine how number sequences come into existence in an economic sense as a result of the social division of labor, economic specialization, and economic exchange. They pay little, if any, attention to the socially recognized systems of numerical symbolization that are used to represent exchange ratios or money prices." (see p. 168).

- Bridge from @HarperJIE2010 to @Lad1996 (Chapter 2-4).

- The DBT relates to Misesian economic calculation (praxeology)
- Exchangeability relates to Hayekian knowledge-and-coordination problems
- Mises-Hayek provide the price-theoretic microfoundations for de Finetti

- There is a small cottage industry in trying to convince Austrians to adopt a probability theory.
    - They are allergic to it. For example, see @CaplanSEJ1999
    - Our claim is stronger:
        - It isn't just that de Finetti's probabilism is compatible with Austrian subjectivism (a nice fit)
        - Austrians are compelled to accept de Finetti by their own price-theoretic microfoundations.
        - De Finetti's derivation of subjective probability **is Misesian economic calculation**
        - Austrians face a Dutch book: accept their own price theory and accept de Finetti OR reject de Finetti and reject their own foundations.
